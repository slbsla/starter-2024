A quick explanation of all the components of our setup and the authentication flow

* We set up our project using springdataJPA, OAuth2 Resource Server, postgres driver, and spring web.
* We created our user package, auth package, and config package.
* We created public-keys and private-keys using OpenSSL for encrypting and decrypting JWTs and linked it to our application through the applicationConfig.yaml and setting up properties.
* we created a user entity and a user repository for making JPA database calls.
* we created an auth user that would manage roles, credentials, etc.
* we created a JpaUserDetailsService for managing user details at sign-in, authService for managing auth logic like generating tokens.
* We created a DTO to help us manage data transfers between the client and server request and response.
* We used created an authController to manage routes for authentication requests like login.
* Then we setup our Security configurations to used Nimbus to manage JWTs and also user our UserDetailsService to manage user details on signin.
